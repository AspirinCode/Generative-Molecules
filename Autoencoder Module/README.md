This is the repo which holds the code laregely adopted from varitional auto-encoder version of generative models. 

Even though the algorithm is quite different, we have adopted their methods in dealing with SMILES dataset. Moreover, such encoder in the auto-encoder model could provide us an efficient approach to find an embedding based on SMILES string.
